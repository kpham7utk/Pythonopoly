Contribution:
I created the dice randomizer the dice rolls for when players moved. I also collaborated on the creation of the structures to represent
the players, properties, and player pieces. Initially I was not satisfied with the dimensions of the game window and the board. So I resized 
the resolution and the board to take up the entirety of the game window. I also rotated the chance and community draw piles so that
they would more closely resemble their real life equivalents. I helped write game features such as buying and selling properties along with
testing to make sure they worked correctly.

Team Assessment: 
I think everyone performed their role well. Communication was not an issue as well met and collaborated easily through discord. 
Every member pulled their own weight and helped others. Constance joined late, but was instrumental in the project after she joined.
Peyton and Sarah did a great job on the visuals such as the board and the starting menu. Collins was greatly helpful as he and I collaborated 
on the properties and making sure they worked correctly.
